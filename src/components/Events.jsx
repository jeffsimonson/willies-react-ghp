            You Were Afraid to Ask:
          </h3>
          <p>
            If you have tasted wine before and the only adjective you have to
            describe it is “winey” this class is for you. This is about taste,
            not terroir. Learn the Get Beyond Winey System of tasting wine and
            the secret element you need in order to truly taste it.
